        <p dir="auto"><em>Last updated: November 12, 2024</em></p>
        <p dir="auto">Thank you for using my apps! I build them hoping to make learning fun and effective. Because I don&rsquo;t know every user personally, I have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.</p>
        <p dir="auto">With &ldquo;Company&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;my&rdquo;, &ldquo;me&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, or &ldquo;us&rdquo; in this document, we are referring to Benjamin Paddags.</p>
        <p dir="auto">When we say &ldquo;Services&rdquo;, we mean our websites, including langam.app, and any product created and maintained by Benjamin Paddags. That includes LanGam, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.</p>
        <p dir="auto">When we say &ldquo;You&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;, we are referring to the people or organizations that visit and use our services and/or own an account with one or more of our Services.</p>
        <p dir="auto">We may update these Terms of Service ("Terms") in the future.&nbsp;Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify account holders.</p>
        <p dir="auto">When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision.&nbsp;<strong>These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</strong></p>
        <p dir="auto">If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account. That&rsquo;s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/bnpd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is behind these services</a>&nbsp;and keeping an open door to <a href="mailto:ben@langam.app">your feedback</a>.</p>
        <div dir="auto">
        <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by us.</p>
        <p>We no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>
        <p>We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that You visit.</p>

        <li>You may not use the Services for any of the following purposes, and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either:
        <ul dir="auto">
        <li>Collect or extract information and/or user data from accounts which do not belong to you.</li>
        <li>Circumvent, disable, or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Services.</li>
        <li>Trick, defraud, or mislead us or other users, including but not limited to making false reports or impersonating another user.</li>

        <li>You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs under your account, including content posted by and activity of any users in your account.</li>
        <li>You must be a human. Accounts registered by &ldquo;bots&rdquo; or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
        <li>You must be over the age of 18. This is due to harsher legal requirements when handling data from children in some regions, which I unfortunately do not currently have the capacity to check. Sorry.</li>

        <ol dir="auto">
        <li>If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and &mdash; just like for customers who pay for our Services &mdash; we do not sell your data.</li>
        <li>For paid versions of Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up and you will be required to provide payment information. After the trial period, we will charge your payment method monthly in advance. If the payment is unsuccessfull, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If your account has been frozen for a while, we will queue it up for auto-cancellation.</li>
        <li>If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle.</li>
        <li>Where required, we will collect sales taxes or equivalent on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. You are responsible for payment of all other taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities.</li>

        <ol dir="auto">
        <li>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked account deletion button. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@langam.app">contact us</a>.</li>
        <li>The Service will be inaccessible immediately upon account cancellation.</li>
        <li>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing cycle.</li>
        <li>We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see point two under Account Terms.</li>

        <li>We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any of our Services or its parts with or without notice.</li>
        <li>Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.</li>

        <li>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for our Services.</li>

        <p dir="auto">We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</p>
        <p dir="auto">We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don&rsquo;t guarantee completely error-free Services.</p>

        <h2>Disputes Resolution</h2>
        <p>If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us.</p>
        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
